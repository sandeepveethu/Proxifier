# Proxifier
A chrome extension for using "working proxies" in one click. Works for IIT Guwahati Intranet Users only.

[Proxy Checker](http://172.16.114.121/PROXY_CHECKER/) provides two working proxies 24/7. Proxifier obtains the working proxies
and creates the boilerplate for proxy change. All you have to do is to select new proxy by clicking on it.

## How to use Proxifier?

1. Download the zip file of master branch of this repository.
2. Extract extension folder from the zip file.
3. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in google chrome.
4. Drag and drop the extension folder on the above mentioned tab.
5. Select the checkbox for allowing Proxifier to work in incognito mode too.
6. That's all.

Now click on the extension icon and select from listed working proxies. Click on "Set System Proxy" button to revert your
browser proxy settings to system proxy settings.
